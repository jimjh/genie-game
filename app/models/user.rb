# == User
# User model empowered by devise. The +rememerable+ and +trackable+ devise
# modules automatically handle the following fields:
# - +remember_created_at+
# - +sign_in_count+
# - +{last,current}_sign_in_{at,ip}+
#
# The +omniauthable+ module handles integration with OmniAuth.
# - +nickname+ is a virtual field that is set when the user is created. It's
#   used to generate the +slugged+ field and can be any string value. However,
#   it is usually just the user's username from the first authorization.
# - +slug+ is generated by +friendly_id+ from +nickname+.
#
# Users do not need to have an authorization when they are created; however,
# every authorization must have a valid user.
